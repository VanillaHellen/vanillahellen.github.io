          <h2>Phone phreaking</h2>
          <div class="history">
          <p>
            Phone phreaking is basically exploiting phone systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in the 50s, the telephone systems used the DTMF - Dual Tone Multi Frequency. They had the numpad, and the system didn't care about the physically pressed button, only about the <i>sound</i> it created.
            Eventually, people noticed that they could manipulate the system by playing correct sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joe Engressia was blind from birth, but he had the perfect pitch - meaning he could remember and recreate any pitch of sound. He was seven years old when he realized he could control the phone by whistling specific pitches, and eventually he found the 2600Hz pitch.
          </p>
          </div>

          <div class="attack">
            <p>
              2600Hz pitch was one of the most popular ones, because it enabled people to call any phone for free. To make it work, you had to make a long distance call, which made the system use the <i>trunk lines</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/trunk_1.png">
              If you played the 2600Hz sound during the course of the call, it caused the trunk line to set to a ready mode, which basically meant it hung up and waited for a new number to call.
            </p>
              <img src="assets/img/trunk_2.png">
            <p>
              <br/>
              Now, if you called a toll-free long distance call, then played the 2600Hz sound, and then played the correct sound dialing a custom number, the trunk line would connect you to the given number, while your local exchange would still think you're making the free long distance call.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regular people couldn't whistle the sounds like Engressia, so they created special devices to do so - so-called boxes, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Blue box - 2600Hz, calling any number for free
                </li>
                <li>
                  Red box - specifically for pay phones, it generated tones that let the pay phone know the coins were inserted. So you could use the pay phones for free.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Black box - a small electronic circuit, that changed the voltage so it didn't start billing. This way you could answer the phone and the caller would not be charged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Violet box - a resistor that made the line appear in use or off-hook.
                </li>
              </ul>


            </p>
          </div>

            <div class="protect">
              <p>
                The phone companies had to change the system in order to end phone phreaking. And indeed, in <b>1983</b> telephone lines were upgraded to CCIS - common-channel interoffice signalling. It transmits the signaling on a different channel than the one used for the messages. Due to that, phone phreakers couldn't exploit the system.
